# The New Internet Laws
### If someone took Godwin's law and created a whole book

## What?
A few days ago, I stumbled upon old usenet laws collected by an old german website. I was fascinated by the laws and how often they found their "use".
So I set out to collect and preserve old laws and find new laws created by users.

### Godwin's law?
> "As an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches 1."

## I want to add something!
Fork the repo, edit the texts to your liking and create a pull request!

### Are there rules about contributions?
Use common sense, means:
- Don't harass anybody
- Don't support negative stereotypes
- Don't invent rules that have no backing or resonance
- Be creative, but don't lie

## I have an issue with a law!
Create an issue and I will look at it.

## Why?
I thought it was funny.
