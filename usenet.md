# The Old Usenet Laws
As compiled by [this german site](http://www.bruhaha.de/laws.html)

## Godwin's Law
The longer a Usenet discussion goes on, the more likely it is that someone will come up with an inappropriate Nazi comparison. Usually the discussion is then declared over and the person in question takes a tonne of *plonk*s.

## Kitzler's Law
Stasi comparisons (analogue to Godwin)

## Seitz' addendum to Godwin's Law
Ditto for inappropriate child molester comparisons, but with the increased risk of not ending the discussion.

## Gassner's Law
Someone who describes certain principles as "typically German" has automatically lost. "Typically German" only comes from those without arguments. They have nothing more to say.
**Noschinski's addition:** It's mostly Germans who talk about "typically German".

## Gassner's Conjecture
Someone who fulfils one law will soon fulfil the others, use pseudonyms or falsify addresses.

## pi's Law
The more heated the discussion, the higher the probability that someone will copy the name of the opponent into the subject line. The person who has done this has automatically lost.

## pi's Second Law
Anyone who abusively changes the subject in order to push their opinion to the fore makes a fool of themselves and has no arguments. If you also change the subject incorrectly, you are a DAU.

## Brülls' Law
The longer a thread gets, the more likely it is that someone will spontaneously jump to the topic of "paedophiles", either to defend civil rights or to restrict them.

## Suter's Law
In the context of a discussion on or about netiquette, as the discussion progresses, newbies tend to become moose and regulars tend to become net sheriffs.
**Kühnert's addition:** Anyone who uses the age, disabilities or other personal characteristics of a discussion participant to portray them as incompetent has automatically lost.

## Heidtmann's Law
If you misuse your opponent's CV as an argument, you lose.

## Hartge's Second Law
Anyone who uses the circumstances of another person's life as an argument in order to attack them or put them in a bad light has no more arguments and therefore automatically loses.

## Tetzlaff's Law
In the course of a Usenet discussion, the likelihood that one of the participants will spout conspiracy theories increases in proportion to the length of the thread towards 1.
**Pluntke's lower bound:** This applies at least to the groups in the de.admin.news hierarchy.

## Brügmann's Law
Whoever cites his opponent's (supposed) operating system as an "argument" in the course of a discussion has lost.

## Hartge's Third Law
If you argue with the newsreader used by your opponent, you really have no more arguments and therefore automatically lose.

## Hoffmann's Law
If someone comments that they have the last word in the thread, several posters will immediately point out that they have the last word.

## Tsang's Law
Anyone who uses the silent masses as a criterion for agreeing or disagreeing with a question has automatically lost.

## Egg's Law
If you want to argue with "do you need this sexually" or similar, you lose.

## Schröder's Law
As soon as someone mentions "mother" and "problem" in the same sentence, Freud is on the table.

## Riedel's Law
The longer a Usenet discussion goes on, the more likely it is that someone will accuse their opponent of wasting taxpayers' money and not paying for their own network connection. That person has automatically lost.

## Hellinger's Law
Whoever comes first with the line "I've been doing RDT for longer than some people have been here in the world" has automatically lost the discussion.

## Borutta's Law
Anyone who, in the course of a discussion, presents a behaviour he disapproves of as typical of an entire generation automatically loses.
**Addition:** In discussions on the subject of netiquette, "the youth" is the preferred generation.

## Roesen's Law
As soon as a troll, DAU or moose encounters fierce criticism in the course of a thread, he argues with the arrogance of the critic. This can also be done as a precaution.

## Krietsch's ego theorem
I have recognised the law on Usenet that anyone who contradicts me is an idiot and has already lost.

## Unterweger's Law
The longer a thread is, the more likely it is that someone will suggest adding the word "intolerance" to the newsgroup name.

## Schulte's Law
Flaming attempts against women always start with "You're ugly".

## Weiland's Law
As soon as a female poster starts talking in a thread, she automatically has the entire attention of the newsgroup, which leads to the death of the original topic.

## Bauer's Law
People who include their "Dr" in the sender field are kind of weird.

## Gienger's Law
The importance of a news posting on Usenet is reciprocal to the number of cumulative exclamation marks it contains.

## Hügelschäfer's Law
Posts are posted where they cause the greatest resistance.

## Gröschel's Law
The more postings it takes to manoeuvre an opponent into a corner on a single aspect of a discussion, the more likely it is that you will forget what you actually wanted to prove when it does work.
**Definition of the indifference of a discussion result:**
As soon as the participants in a discussion have forgotten what they actually wanted to prove, the discussion ends in a draw.

## Hüls' generalisation (law of large numbers for the Usenet)
As the thread length increases, the probability of any behaviour of the discussion participants that is not inherently impossible increases trivially.
**Anomaly:**
The probability that the panellists will end the thread early probably does not increase with the thread length.

## Kohr's Law
Anyone who has lost a discussion because of one or more laws claims that these laws are nonsense anyway.

## Raimund's Law
He who allows himself to be provoked has lost.

## The Peukert Law
Everyone wants their own law.
**Krahl's extension:** Whoever invents any law just to find his name in the list of laws has lost.

## Brügmann's Law-Law
In every discussion about Usenet laws, there comes a time when the laws are regarded as laws that can come into force, for example. Whoever starts with that has lost and the discussion has become pointless.

## Suter's Second Law
If someone asks 'is there already a law for...', then someone else will name the law after the questioner.

## Esken's Law
Anyone who denies others a law with reference to its meaningfulness or Usenet-specificity etc. has automatically lost.

## Braun's Law
If someone tries to create a law, someone else will use existing laws to make him realise that the law already exists.

## Esken's Big Question
How is it that no law survives in its raw state, but still needs a revision of the formulation?

## Lemken's Law
Whoever writes "You loose" has automatically lost.

## Brügmann's induction
After the n-th law, there is still an n+1-th law.

## Fulfilment of Brügmann's Law
Whenever one of the laws is asked for, one of the laws is fulfilled after a short time.
**Mickey's tightening:** The law that is asked for is always fulfilled.

## Barth's Law
From a certain state of the law discussion, people not only fulfil laws, but also write them in their postings.

## Perkowsky's Law
Anyone who claims the fulfilment of an incorrect law in the course of a discussion in order to have the discussion deemed closed has lost.

## Haug's Law
The longer a Usenet discussion lasts, the higher the probability that someone will use an inappropriate Usenet law to declare their opponent the loser. That person has then automatically lost.

## Peukert's Second Law
If someone uses Nazi or 3rd Reich comparisons with the intention of ending a thread using Godwin's Law, it immediately loses effect.

## Barth's axiom
The number of registered laws will always be finite. But there are an infinite number of laws - only most of them are not registered. So the thesis is: The laws exist - you just have to write them down and name them.

## Krahnke's 1st conclusion
Once there is a critical mass of laws, more and more trivialities will inevitably be identified as laws.

## Weimer's Corollary
After a certain length, every thread tends to become self-referential.

## The Donnerhacke axiom
If a thread shows self-references, it becomes recursive and the Usenet becomes fractal. The contributor of the self-reference has lost.

## Ringeisen's Law
Whoever accuses the other person - without responding to his argumentation - of arguing "politically correct" has lost the right to be taken seriously on this point.

## Müller's Law
Anyone who replies (exclusively) with "no reply", "no comment" or similar has lost.

## Herrmann's Law
Anyone who argues with a panellist's spelling mistakes and typos has lost.

## Hartge's Law
Anyone who tries to spelling-flame is guaranteed to make the criticised mistakes themselves.
**Hoffmann's extension:** Those who complain the loudest about cross-posting continue to cross-post themselves without setting a follow-up to. If one has already been set, it will of course not be noticed.

## Aller's Law
The more appropriate an author feels their quote is for a signature, the less likely it is that someone will actually use it in a signature.

## mico's Law
The longer a discussion lasts, the more likely it is that someone will include an absolutely pointless expression from their discussion partner in their own signature.

## Krahl's Law
Once one of the Usenet laws has been fulfilled, the discussion is over. Whoever continues the discussion has just not realised it yet.

## pi's refinement of Krahl's Law
Anyone who postulates the end of a debate using a relevant Usenet law and then continues it anyway is shooting themselves in the foot.

## rolfzwei's Law
Whenever someone declares that they are not a Usenet dictator or that they do not want to achieve world domination, they have won and the thread is closed.
